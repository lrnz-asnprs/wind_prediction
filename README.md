# Wind Prediction Project

Within this project I have implemented a data preprocessing pipeline for a small wind energy forecasting system using sklearn. I'd used data from Orkney, an archipelago off the north eastern coast of Scotland. Orkney has around 20,000 inhabitants and they produce around Â» 120% of their annual energy consumption in wind energy.

## Usage

Simply go ahead and run the cells in the notebook to generate the predictions and plots.
The project includes data exploration and visualization, a data preprocessing pipeline using sklearn and an comparison of the accuracy of a polynomial regression model versus K-nearest neighbors using KFold cross validation.

## Results

Since the correlation between wind speed and total energy produced is not clearly linear, I used a polynomial transformation to better fit the models (Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors) to the underlying data. As a result I was able to fit my model to a polynomial line as depicted in the figure below.

I used k-fold cross validation to compare the performance of the two models I have implemented. It turns out that KNN performs slightly better (ME=0.653, SE=0.023) than the Linear Regression (ME=0.652, SE=0.020). However, accuracy is rather low for both models, due to the high variance of the data and the simplicity of the models.
