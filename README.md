# Wind Prediction Project

Within this project I have implemented a data preprocessing pipeline for a small wind energy forecasting system using sklearn. I'd used data from Orkney, an archipelago off the north eastern coast of Scotland. Orkney has around 20,000 inhabitants and they produce around Â» 120% of their annual energy consumption in wind energy.

## Description

Simply run the cells in the notebook to generate the predictions and plots.
The project includes data exploration and visualization, a data preprocessing pipeline using sklearn and an comparison of the accuracy of a polynomial regression model versus K-nearest neighbors using KFold cross validation.

### Dependencies
Libraries used:
* Pandas & NumPy
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
